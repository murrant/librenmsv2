Introduction
------------

LibreNMS is an autodiscovering PHP/MySQL/SNMP based network monitoring
which includes support for a wide range of network hardware and operating
systems including Cisco, Linux, FreeBSD, Juniper, Brocade, Foundry, HP and
many more.  LibreNMS is a community-based fork of [Observium][9].

We intend LibreNMS to be a viable project and community that:
- encourages contribution,
- focuses on the needs of its users, and
- offers a welcoming, friendly environment for everyone.

The [Debian Social Contract][10] will be the basis of our priority system,
and mutual respect is the basis of our behaviour towards others.  For more
about the culture we're trying to build, please read the [Freenode
philosophy][13], including [guidelines for running an IRC channel][6] and
[being a community catalyst][7].
